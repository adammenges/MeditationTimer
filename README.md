MeditationTimer
===============

Very simple meditation timer for the terminal. I figured I'd throw it up here for anyone who wanted it. Feel free to use it for anything you wish. Best used full screen:

Usage
=====

    python MeditationTimer # For 10 minutes
    python MeditationTimer 15 # For 15 minutes
   
I'd suggest adding an alias in your bashrc for `MeditationTimer` to something like `med`, or adding it to your path. This way, you can just type `med 5` when you need to quickly meditate for 5 minutes.
